Heart Failure Prediction - Ongoing Project
Overview
This project aims to develop machine learning models to predict heart failure based on clinical features. The data used for this study is derived from a publicly available dataset detailed in the following research article: [Heart Failure Prediction Dataset](https://bmcmedinformdecismak.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12911-020-1023-5#Sec2).

Machine Learning Models:

I am currently experimenting with several machine learning models to identify the most effective approach for predicting heart failure. The models under consideration include:

1. Support Vector Machines (SVM) with RBF kernel

2. Decision Tree

3. Random Forest

4. Gradient Boosting using XGBoost

5. Light GBM

Current Status

The project is in an active development phase. I am still working on:

Analyzing and interpreting feature importances to better understand the predictors of heart failure.
Completing the final comprehensive report that will detail my findings and methodology.
Identifying and implementing improvements to the models to enhance prediction accuracy.
Stay tuned for updates as I continue to refine the models and findings.
